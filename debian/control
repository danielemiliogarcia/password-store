Description: stop pass(1) passwords ending up in Vim cache files
 This Vim/Neovim plugin switches off the 'viminfo', 'backup', 'writebackup',
 'swapfile', and 'undofile' options globally when editing a password in
 pass(1).  This is to prevent anyone being able to extract passwords from
 your Vim cache files in the event of a compromise.
